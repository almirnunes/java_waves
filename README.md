Animations used in the Coastal Hydraulics Course at Lund University.

These files, created by Prof. Robert A. Dalrymple, are being hosted as a backup at https://dalrymple-linear-waves.netlify.app/
Apparently the original site (http://www.coastal.udel.edu/faculty/rad/index.html) is broken, I found these files at http://homepages.cae.wisc.edu/~chinwu/Coastal_Java/ and decided to also host it here.

To run these java applets in modern browsers, I recommend using the Google Chrome extension called [CheerpJ Applet Runner](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cheerpj-applet-runner/bbmolahhldcbngedljfadjlognfaaein).
